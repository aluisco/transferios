# TransferiOS

A Flutter application to improve the experience and interaction with magnetic cards and Cuban banks.
There is only sample code and some functional screens to display information, there is nothing relevant.

## Getting Started

If you want to contribute to its development you can contact me and we will expand it, it is basically designed for iOS but it can be exported to any platform that supports the execution of USSD codes.

You can clone the repo and make any improvements you see fit, everyone is welcome.
